    Hy, my name is Nyitrai Zsolt and this is my first website

        In highschool i learned a little in Pascal
        but most of it was on paper and when i saw the program
        and how ugly it was i decided i dont want to do anything with programming.
    So in 2012 after i finished highschool i went to
    "Universitatea Tehnica Cluj Napoca, Facultatea de instalatii"
    I wanted to build projects no matter what i had to work with computers
    becouse i knew i am good with computers and
    i was made for sitting in front of one for days, i had the patience and i also like it.
        But not coding.
    I finished college, after 2 months got a job at SC Anda Paula SRL. The job was great,
    I learned a lot, how to not die from pressure was the hardest to learn, but it was good.
        The problem was nobody told me being a project engineer means 80% paper work.
    In 2018 I decided to give coding another try. Went to Fasttrack IT Web developer classes,
    tried to learn HTML CSS Javascript, got stuck at javascript, i did not have the time
    to learn it with a fulltime job, but managed to pick up some things.
        At work there were only 2 people left at the office so i felt like i couldn't leave yet
        to find another job. I did not want to be the bad guy.
    After 2 years i left my job to have time to learn.
        And now here i am
