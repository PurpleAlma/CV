            Hy, my name is Nyitrai Zsolt and this is my first website.

                In highschool i learned a little in Pascal
                but most of it was on paper and when i saw the program
                and how ugly it was i decided i dont want to do anything with programming.
            So in 2012 after i finished highschool i went to
            "Universitatea Tehnica Cluj Napoca, Facultatea de instalatii"
            I wanted to build projects no matter what i had to work with computers
            becouse i knew i am good with computers and
            i was made for sitting in front of one for days, i had the patience and i also like it.
                But not coding.
            I finished college, after 2 months got a job at SC Anda Paula SRL. The job was great,
            I learned a lot, how to not die from pressure was the hardest to learn, but it was good.
                The problem was nobody told me being a project engineer means 80% paper work.
            In 2018 I decided to give coding another try. Went to Fasttrack IT Web developer classes,
            tried to learn HTML CSS Javascript, got stuck at javascript, i did not have the time
            to learn it with a fulltime job, but managed to pick up some things.
                At work there were only 2 people left at the office so i felt like i couldn't leave yet
                to find another job. I did not want to be the bad guy.
            After 2 years i left my job to have time to learn.
                And now here i am
