                Hy, my name is Nyitrai Zsolt and this is my first website.

                    In highschool i learned a little in Pascal
                    but most of it was on paper and when i saw the program
                    and how ugly it was i decided i dont want to do anything with programming.
                So in 2012 after i finished highschool i went to
                "Universitatea Tehnica Cluj Napoca, Facultatea de instalatii"
                I wanted to build projects, no matter what, i had to work with computers
                because i felt most confident in front of one, and 
                i was made for sitting near computers for days, i had the patience and i also like it.
                    But coding made me feel stupid.
                I finished college, after 2 months got a job at SC Anda Paula SRL. The job was great,
                I learned a lot, how to not die from pressure was the hardest to learn, but it was good.
                    The problem was nobody told me being an engineer in an office means 80% paper work.
                In 2018 I decided to give coding another try. Went to Fasttrack IT Web developer classes,
                tried to learn HTML CSS Javascript, got stuck at javascript, i did not have the time
                to learn it with a fulltime job, but managed to pick up some things.
                    At work there were only 2 people left at the office so i felt like i couldn't leave yet
                    to find another job. I didn't want to be the bad guy.
                After 2 years i left my job to have time to learn.
                    And now here i am!
